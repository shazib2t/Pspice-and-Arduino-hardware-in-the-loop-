# Pspice-and-Arduino-hardware-in-the-loop-
Live Pspice Simulation Using Sensor Fused Arduino

ABSTRACT

As an engineers, designers, hobbyists and anyone who nurture with technology for a low-cost, easy-to-use technology to create their 
creative, interactive objects, useful projects etc., A whole new level of projects can now be built that can be controlled from a computer.
The present work has been concentrated to environmental parameters such as temperature, light detection, angle detection and others. 
The data logger which is particularly the Pspice which is proposed to be developed with the use of Arduino Uno 
based on ATmega328 microcontroller IC. The Arduino Microcontroller board is used which has inbuilt ADC and other 
peripheral circuitry necessary for operation. The physical parameter is sensed by the sensors and is converted into analog signal. 
This analog signal is fed to the Arduino board ADC pins which is then converted in to an equivalent digital quantity 
and is further processed in the microcontroller. The raw digital signal or processed signal out of microcontroller will be displayed 
on the Pspice simulation. This data is sent to computer through the USB serial port.
